      <description>effffn, mac and DEF CON would like to thank the hard-working NOC Goons for making the on-site conference network, well, work.&#xA;#sparky, booger, CRV, c0mmiebstrd, Dp1i, c7five, Jon2, deadication, musa, wish, johntitor, MikeD and Toph put in long hours (some on-site and some remotely) in making sure everything worked at least at one point in time. And then got them fixed when you (or quite possibly we) broke something.&#xA;As usual, also a huge thank you to Caesars IT and Encore for making our lives a bit easier.</description>
