      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welp, another year, another DEF CON come and gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, it was a big success for the DEF CON NOC. We tried out a few new&#xA;things that went well. The biggest one was some wireless bridges. For&#xA;&lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt;, we had a shortened on site setup time, so we really had to cut down&#xA;our install time. Mostly this meant cutting down on the number of floor wired&#xA;drops that we could provide or providing them in a much fast way. We opted for&#xA;the second option by providing some wireless bridges. We&amp;rsquo;ll put up a post later&#xA;with the specifics of these, but all in all, we think they did the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
