      <description>&lt;p&gt;30 years of DEF CON! It was great times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a NOC perspective it was a good year. Mostly thanks to Mac, who made a few trips&#xA;pre-con to Vegas to have some equipment staged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall everything worked. Wi-Fi coverage at the Caesar Forum was pretty awesome.&#xA;The only minor annoyance was that certain flavors of Android did not like the certificate&#xA;format we had initially posted on wifireg. Eventually folks figured out how to convert it&#xA;using openssl and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
