      <description>Thank you EVERYONE who made Def Con 18 so successful - which is every one of you! Speakers, staff, press, contest &amp;amp; event organizers, and just as importantly the attendees! This was the best con I&amp;rsquo;ve personally had in years!&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m still unpacking a little, but wanted to get the NOC Team&amp;rsquo;s closing slides up (I added a few more stats that effffn had sent over to me) so you now have the complete set.</description>

      <description>Good MORNING! Yes, Sunday Morning&amp;hellip; which most people sleep through due to the events of Saturday night. Here at DefConNetworking, we understand. Ugh, we understand!&#xA;But last night was awesome - the Ninja&amp;rsquo;s threw a blow-out party - it was awesome! Many thanks to Barkode &amp;amp; all the Ninja Networks guys for taking care of people. I was really pleased to see a number of DefCon newbies at the party, too.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s your Saturday morning update&amp;hellip; wait, it&amp;rsquo;s Saturday already?!&#xA;Wireless is working well again - we think we have a hold on the rebooting AP&amp;rsquo;s. We are curious if the ninja badges are interfering with wifi (or is our wifi interferring with the badges? The badges have the ninjas; does that make DefCon&amp;rsquo;s wifi the pirates?! FIGHT!)&#xA;Wired network (speakers, press, staff) - 5x5. Someone asked for a 30&amp;rsquo;ft cross-over cable today.</description>

      <description>The wifi access points are randomly rebooting (cycling about every 15 mins). We&amp;rsquo;re working on fixing it now.</description>

      <description>DefCon has opened. The network is functioning.&#xA;Two issues you should be aware of&amp;hellip;&#xA;https://wifireg.defcon.org - Sorry, we forgot to ask DT to put this in his public DNS servers (fail!) - so that&amp;rsquo;s happening now. It works from the internal network ok. Or from the external network you can use https://208.95.78.182 until DNS propogates.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some mobile devices (mostly ipads) are having issues renewing their IP after coming out of sleep.</description>

      <description>Had a long day yesterday - we caught up on things and got things to about 80% complete.&#xA;The understanding of DefCon hit Jesse&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;DefCon is all about drinking all day and staying out until 0600 and then getting up at 0700&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This morning we&amp;rsquo;re running around, getting everything patched up, switches dropped, wifiz re-verified. Everything is on-track to be finished by the end of today.</description>

      <description>The first day of setup ended about midnight last night. The Inter-webs came up quickly after we had breakfast. The NOC is live &amp;amp; fully functional. The Queen Victoria Pub doth rocketh. Our WiFiz got delayed, but since it&amp;rsquo;s the same (physical) setup as last year we just need to unpack &amp;amp; go. App servers are up &amp;amp; functional. All &amp;amp; all, things are coming along nicely. We have to be completely done by EOD Wednesday (which is anytime before 8a Thursday).</description>

      <description>WiFi self-reg is all set, tested, validated.&#xA;Data for all speakers, con-events, and DJ&amp;rsquo;s are loaded into the World Domination Database (thanks to Neil &amp;amp; Nikita for providing the data) - the back-end for the DefCon18 Mobile Edition agenda. Still have to load contests once I get some more infoz. t3ase continues his work on CSS-ifying DC-ME (no pressure!).&#xA;Plus, Mac &amp;amp; Videoman have the core infrastructure laid out &amp;amp; base configs completed.</description>

      <description>effffn &amp;amp; I stayed up late last night &amp;amp; got the secure wifi configuration working. I want to do some cleanup on the radius config files, but we have working WPA2 + 802.1x setup!&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m setting up &amp;ldquo;self registration&amp;rdquo; so attendees can create their own logins for the system today. I hope Neil doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind I&amp;rsquo;m stealing his CSS :)</description>

      <description>We got tweeted! Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not as being slashdotted (don&amp;rsquo;t get any ideas!) - but thanks for DT or Neil for giving us the shout-out!&#xA;20 days until DC18 starts!&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to be an interesting year with floorplan changes, wifi changes, focus on DCTV &amp;amp; a/v streaming (shouts to DJ Great Scott for being so easy to work with, btw!). And the DefCon Confessional is BACK!&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re even jumping in and providing a &amp;ldquo;Mobile Edition&amp;rdquo; agenda webapp that will be available locally.</description>

      <description>DefCon18 - 40 days away.&#xA;Bandwidth contract has been signed. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say, between you &amp;amp; mean, that it&amp;rsquo;s unprecedented bandwidth (WRT DefCon).</description>

      <description>We have a lot going on this year, preparing for your use &amp;amp; pleasure. Let me catch you up&amp;hellip;&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re planning on having a &amp;lsquo;secure&amp;rsquo; segment of the wireless this year. Designed so you can get on and be (as sure as possible) that no one&amp;rsquo;s sniffing your traffic and you won&amp;rsquo;t get jacked up.&#xA;We know 3G is getting saturated, so you need to feel OK putting your phone or device on the net just to get to the Internet (and yes, more bandwidth for everyone!</description>

      <description>We wanted to wish everyone a very Happy New Year (now that January is almost over?)&#xA;We still owe posting configs for peer review - apologies that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been done yet. Following DefCon each year everyone tends to go into hibernation until the New Year. But as we easy into the new year DC18 planning starts up. We&amp;rsquo;ll try to get that done real soon for you.&#xA;DT &amp;amp; I have talked about trying some new interactivity at DC18.</description>
