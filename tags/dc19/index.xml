      <title>Utilization @ 1345</title>

      <description>Network utilization currently at 94% (on inbound).&#xA;For the mathematically challenged, that&amp;rsquo;s 94Mb (we have a 100Mb circuit).&#xA;Outbound is running about 20Mb (probably torrents seeding).</description>

      <description>9:30p - the day is largely over (other than parties at this point).&#xA;Not much bandwidth consumed today - a few spikes, but generally hovered around 10-14Mbps.&#xA;DCTV seems generally well-received. The feeds from the cameras don&amp;rsquo;t mix speaker &amp;amp; slides so we had to pick one feed to broadcast. We&amp;rsquo;re already talking about major upgrades next year - but since this is the first time since the AP we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to do this, we got a lot of ideas for making DC20 a major step-up.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DefConSecure&amp;rdquo; is ready for use, although we still have some AP&amp;rsquo;s to deploy once rooms are turned over to us. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to get prepared for DefCon, get your login setup from home (or other network you &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rsquo;). Go to https://wifireg.defcon.org/ and reserve your login.</description>

      <description>First post! ZOMFG! l33t!&#xA;This post is officially made from the DefCon 19 Network!&#xA;The core is up and working. A couple IDF&amp;rsquo;s still have to be patched. Wall ports &amp;amp; floor jacks are mostly patched by the hotel, just need to be patched panel-to-switch in the IDF&amp;rsquo;s. The last of the AP&amp;rsquo;s are being provisioned right now by Luiz &amp;amp; Erick (he&amp;rsquo;s new this year, say hi to him!). The NOC is up &amp;amp; functional!</description>

      <description>We have arrived and unpacked. With hotel staff on-site &amp;amp; able to help us today, we expect to have the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; network up today and the NOC fully functional. Well ahead of schedule!</description>

      <description>Well, for us, tomorrow begins the madness! Mac &amp;amp; I caravan up from San Diego tomorrow, with most everyone else on Sunday.&#xA;Some gear&amp;rsquo;s been shipped. Most the rest is coming up in my truck. Got enough cabling to LAN-ify the workshops per requests. WiFi&amp;rsquo;s working, core gear&amp;rsquo;s setup &amp;amp; working. Need to finish up some stuff on the Mobile Edition agenda-app, but it&amp;rsquo;s nearly done. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a great year at the Rio!</description>

      <description>The DefCon 19 Network will offer IPv6 on all networks. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be running dual-stack v4/v6.&#xA;What will you do with v6?</description>

      <description>DefCon Mobile Edition v2.0 (DCMEv2). T3ase has been hard at work, re-doing the front-end for the Mobile Edition web-app, taking feedback from last year, ensuring better multi-device compatibility, etc. He seems to be really proud of it, but hasn&amp;rsquo;t let anyone see it yet - should I be worried? :)</description>

      <description>Less than 3 weeks til the DCNET crew heads to Vegas. We&amp;rsquo;re planning a full test of network gear this weekend, doing our best to make sure we&amp;rsquo;ve got everything as done-as-possible prior to being on-site. Since it&amp;rsquo;s a new year, new hotel, we&amp;rsquo;re trying to be prepared against the unexpected.&#xA;We have most everyone&amp;rsquo;s network requirements on our list at this point. Contest area may be our biggest challenge - I think we have requests for more drops than we have wall jacks in that room.</description>

      <description>Four more weeks and the Goons head off to Vegas to start DefCon setup. New hotel, new challenges, but we think it&amp;rsquo;ll all pay off!&#xA;Our aim is to have all the core network gear fully tested, end-to-end, in a couple weeks. The goal is to arrive in Vegas and all we have to do is supply power and start patching jacks! (Let&amp;rsquo;s hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t just jinx it)&#xA;We first announced this publicly at DC4420 (London)(@DC4420) last month - but we&amp;rsquo;re going to bring IPv6 to the DefCon network this year.</description>
