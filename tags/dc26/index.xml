      <description>effffn and DEF CON would like to thank all the hard work and planning of our rockstar NOC team, they put a lot of work in so you guys can enjoy many aspects of the con.&#xA;As usual, by the time you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, months of planning happened and crazy few days of execution on site have been lived to cover everything we do for the con, especially now with multiple venues.</description>
