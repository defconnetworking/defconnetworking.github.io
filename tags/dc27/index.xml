      <description>effffn and DEF CON once again would like to thank our hard-working NOC team for making the conference network, well, work across all the hotels hosting the conference.&#xA;Lots of planning, countless emails and a few phone calls precede the crazy-busy week in Vegas.&#xA;While many get to enjoy hacker-summer-camp in style, mac, #sparky, booger, CRV, c0mmiebstrd, Dp1i, c7five, Jon2, deadication, k4tn155, wish, johntitor, MikeD and Toph put in long hours in making sure everything worked at least at one point in time and then got them fixed when something (or you) broke it.</description>
