        <p>Welp, another year, another DEF CON come and gone.</p>
<p>On the whole, it was a big success for the DEF CON NOC. We tried out a few new
things that went well. The biggest one was some wireless bridges. For
<em>reasons</em>, we had a shortened on site setup time, so we really had to cut down
our install time. Mostly this meant cutting down on the number of floor wired
drops that we could provide or providing them in a much fast way. We opted for
the second option by providing some wireless bridges. We&rsquo;ll put up a post later
with the specifics of these, but all in all, we think they did the job.</p>
<p>We of course ran into a few hiccups, some self inflicted. As usual, the
bandwidth crunch was a thing on the first day. Apparently, DEF CON is the time
for everyone to download all of the patches when arriving onsite, because,
well, reasons. Luckily, bossman DT paid for the bandwidth upgrade, doubling our
overall commit from 500Mbps to 1Gbps. On the whole, we feel it worked out over
the rest of the weekend. We&rsquo;re gonna start there next time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you forget the little things, like making sure you have enough log
retention to be able to count number of devices and what not, and then you
forget the little things like test after configurations and updates. And
sometimes, you then have to have appointments that just don&rsquo;t work well with
making changes. Sometimes. Well, completely unrelated, Saturday there was a
DHCP outage. It was a quick fix, but still took a bit to respond because, well
sometimes.</p>
<p>Lastly, the third system wide thing was running out of source states on the
firewall. No matter how much you test blasting the thing, there&rsquo;s always the
scenarios you hit when going into production. Again, luckily, it was a quick
fix, but still lessoned learned.</p>
<p>Now, to the numbers. To give you an insight into what we did, here&rsquo;s some of
the normal usage and build out stats:</p>

<p>If you give the bandwidth, people will come. We&rsquo;re looking at making sure to
keep or increase that in the budget for next year. But, just uh, try to patch
before getting here. We do what we can, but still recommend against unpatched
systems out there.</p>
<p>Expect a follow up on the wireless stats. We&rsquo;re getting more and more data out
of those, just to see what people are playing with.</p>
<p>Until then, thanks for using the network. And thanks for being understanding
when there are issues. We know how critical it is to your experience here, and
aim to provide the best we can with what we got. It&rsquo;s always a balance, but
it&rsquo;s good to see the overall numbers increasing every year, and expect to see
more and more good things in the future.</p>
<p>Have fun, kids,</p>
