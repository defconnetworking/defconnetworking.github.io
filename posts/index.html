        <p>Another DEF CON is in the books.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a bit of a dip. I think the change of things lead to a lot of
unknowns, and it shows in the stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% less interwebz bits</li>
<li>15% less registered users on wifi</li>
<li>10% less concurrent users on wifi</li>
</ul>
<p>For full information, see the <a href="/media/DC32/DC32-slides-NOC.pdf">slides</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of incidents to follow up on, but probably the most impactful is to the
core. Our firewall is giving up the ghost. We bought this one back in 2014, so 10
years seems to be a more than reasonable time of service. We will be sure to give
it a proper Viking funeral and send it across the Rainbow Bridge.</p>
<p>(Planned) New gear this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>core switch</li>
<li>dozen more edge switches</li>
<li>oh, and the whole freakin&rsquo; facility
<ul>
<li>including 650 Access Points</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a new space, everything went exceptionally well. The DEF CON NOC team
completed the their work…not only did they complete it…they did it faster, and
more efficiently than we have ever. These people are simply the best of the best.
The team work, the helping hands, the consistent team spirit in the face of
staggering pressure and odds has been out standing.</p>
<p>Thanks to the entire NOC crew: miked, c7five, booger, deadication, dp1i, crv,
jon2, wish, strange, k4tn155, toph, commiebstrd, duffguy, tater, meibo, and
johntitor. And a special thanks to NOC lead emeritus and still active NOC goon,
effffn!</p>
<p>The operations group at DC should also be commended for putting on what could be
arguably the best DefCon ever! Thanks to DT, Janet, Nikita, Mo and GAG LAB
Department Leads, QM, every other goon, and to all of you.</p>
<p>To Cox, thank you guys for being there. Your dedication to getting it done is not
only critical to our success, but building new relationships with ground crews is
hard and your guys were always rad!</p>
<p>Thanks to the LVCVA for hosting and working with us. We love the site and look
forward to many DEF CONs to come.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the lulz, and see ya next year,</p>
<p>sparky and mac</p>

a bit in arears. Meh &ndash;mac.]</p>
<p>Another DEF CON is in the books.</p>
<p>Overall, we saw more usage than any previous year:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% more interwebz bits</li>
<li>30% more registered users on wifi</li>
<li>25% more concurrent users on wifi</li>

<p>Thanks to DT and the DEF CON staff, all of the other goons, the inhumans, and to
all of you. You&rsquo;re why we do this, and we&rsquo;re happy to make this happen.</p>
<p>And especially thanks to our hosting partners: Phil, Harry, Mable, and the whole Cesars IT and Encore crews for going above and beyond to help us make this happen.</p>
<p>As a last note, we have to announce a change in leadership. effffn is trying to
get some of his life back, and so is stepping back. #sparky, who&rsquo;s been with the
NOC the longest, is stepping up and stepping in.</p>
<p><strong>I welcome our new Canadian overlord!</strong></p>

        <p>30 years of DEF CON! It was great times.</p>
<p>From a NOC perspective it was a good year. Mostly thanks to Mac, who made a few trips
pre-con to Vegas to have some equipment staged.</p>
<p>Overall everything worked. Wi-Fi coverage at the Caesar Forum was pretty awesome.
The only minor annoyance was that certain flavors of Android did not like the certificate
format we had initially posted on wifireg. Eventually folks figured out how to convert it
using openssl and make it work.</p>
<p>And, not the least:
effffn, mac and DEF CON would like to thank the indefatigable NOC team for their hard work.
Sparky, booger, CRV, c0mmiebstrd, Dp1i, c7five, Jon2, deadication, musa,
wish, johntitor, MikeD, Toph and strange do a great job and work long hours so you can internetz.
Lastly, a huge thank you to Phil, Kevin, Mable and the whole Caesars IT and Encore staff for going
above and beyond to make our lives easier.
(and yes, that was a copy and paste from the DC 30 program)</p>

        <p>effffn and DEF CON once again would like to thank our hard-working NOC team for
making the conference network, well, work across all the hotels hosting the
conference.</p>
<p>Lots of planning, countless emails and a few phone calls precede the crazy-busy
week in Vegas.</p>

c0mmiebstrd, Dp1i, c7five, Jon2, deadication, k4tn155, wish, johntitor, MikeD
and Toph put in long hours in making sure everything worked at least at one
point in time and then got them fixed when something (or you) broke it.</p>
<p>If you happen to see one of these folks around, usually at bar that is closest
to the NOC, take a minute to thank them and possibly buy them a round of orange
whipps. Actually, if you run into any of them throughout the year, see if they
would like you to buy them one of their drinks of their choice.</p>

our lives a bit easier.</p>

        <p>effffn and DEF CON would like to thank all the hard work and planning of our
rockstar NOC team, they put a lot of work in so you guys can enjoy many aspects
of the con.</p>
<p>As usual, by the time you&rsquo;re reading this, months of planning happened and crazy
few days of execution on site have been lived to cover everything we do for the
con, especially now with multiple venues. We strive to attend requests from
mostly all departments of the con, from vendors, speakers, press, contests, DC
TV, workshops, infobooth and so on.</p>
<p>mac, #sparky, CRV, c0mmiebstrd, c7five, Jon2, deadication, musa, wish and
johntitor sacrificed a great portion of their DEF CON experience to making sure
everything breaks the right way (so we know how to fix it ASAP). If you happen
to run into any of them anytime in the future, please make sure you thank them

<p>A bunch of things are ready though. For example, you can sign-up for the
802.1x/WPA2 WiFi at <a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org">https://wifireg.defcon.org</a>
before you head to Caesars.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions are provided there, but the short is: create your
credentials (don&rsquo;t use the same as in important stuff!); download and install
the digital certificate (or configuration profile for Apple devices).</p>
<p>Setup your device to REQUIRE server validation and don&rsquo;t accept ANY certificates
provided when you connect. Don&rsquo;t make security insecure.</p>
<p>DCTV this year is available at the con-hotel with 5 channels being broadcasted,
and 4 channels being broadcasted to Paris and Ballys.</p>
<p>That is it for now, updates will be provided here and also on Twitter
@DEFCON_NOC.</p>

convenient DC TV channels for that late morning hangover cure in the
convenience of your hotel room.</p>
<p>It has been said before, and we will say it again: mac, videoman,
#sparky, booger, naifx, arh@wk, nocit, CRV, c0mmiebstrd, serif and
c7five dedicated a great portion of their DEF CON experience to making
sure everything breaks (and if it does, to fix it). So, yeah If you

      <div class="grid_9 contentBody">
        <p>In response to the
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/01/prn_and_pwning_inside_the_blackhat_vegas_noc_where_even_zeus_is_cool/">article that was posted by the Register</a>,
the DEF CON Network Operations Center Team (NOC) pride ourselves on making a
network that allows the community to get Internet access, and have access to
internal resources (Servers, etc.). The DEF CON NOC believes in privacy and
anonymity for our attendees.</p>
<p>When users attach to the DefCon Secure (802.1x/PEAP) network, we have made the
decision to do our best to make that data/traffic inaccessible, and the team
does not allow for data monitoring, nor recording of the traffic. We do have
overall bandwidth monitoring- but will never run driftnet, ntop or other tools
that invade the privacy of the users on the secure network.</p>
<p>The DEF CON network resources, and staff who volunteer in the NOC at DEF CON
currently do not have any part in the operations of the Black Hat network(s).
The DEF CON NOC also doesn’t allow vendors to use the network as a place to demo
or experiment with our user’s traffic.</p>
<p>Now… If you happen to attach to any network that does not have the more secure
certificate authentication method enabled – all bets are off. Your traffic will
be monitored – not by us, but by the people around you. We also ship the open
WiFi network traffic off to the Wall of Sheep as well, and anyone on the
unsecure network can and will easily Man-In-The-Middle your traffic.</p>
<p>If you want to get on the “DefCon” Secure network- follow the instructions that
are posted on <a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org/">https://wifireg.defcon.org/</a>. Each PEAP session that is created
from the client to the controller is a unique session, and is not allowed to
talk to any of the other users on the network once connected to the official
network.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about someone capturing your credentials, you don’t want to
register ad userid, or want to maintain anonymity we have also setup a common
username and password of defcon/defcon. So if someone says that they captured
your credentials, it’s really not that big of a deal, especially when everyone
has a unique session.</p>
<p>You should still install and only trust the certificates that we have posted on
<a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org/">https://wifireg.defcon.org/</a>.</p>

      <div class="grid_9 contentBody">
        <p>It seems like there is a number of Android devices that have issues validating
the server certificate for 802.1x authentication.</p>
<p>We did some research and it seems like it is a common issue with different
Android OS and hardware flavors. We can’t put our finger on it but it seems like
it is the native 802.1x supplicant within Android.</p>
<p>There are 3rd party supplicants but at this point this is not one that we can
recommend.</p>
<p>We do not encourage anyone to connect to the ESSID “DefCon” without validating
the server certificate.</p>
<p>As for the steps to correctly configure it:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to <a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org">https://wifireg.defcon.org</a></li>
<li>download the DigiCert Root Certificate</li>
<li>create your credentials on <a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org">https://wifireg.defcon.org</a></li>
<li>some flavors of Android automatically understand it’s a cert and will prompt
you for install, choose this cert to be used on WiFi (and not VPN and Apps)</li>
<li>go to wifi configuration</li>
<li>add new network</li>
<li>ESSID: DefCon</li>
<li>802.1x Enterprise</li>
<li>PEAP</li>
<li>MSCHAPV2</li>
<li>Identify: enter username you created on wifireg</li>
<li>Password: enter password you created on wifireg</li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration above is pretty much the same for any other devices out there.</p>
<p>Any further updates on this matter will be posted here.</p>

        <p>howdy! It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>Just a quick note to say that yes, the 802.1X auth&rsquo;d SSID is back for DC22.</p>
<p>The registration server should go live today or tomorrow so you can create your
credentials before hand to get to the conference network in a more secure
fashion.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t really need to tell you this but: DO NOT use credentials that you
use in any other important systems, like your corporate windows domain.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;re working through the funks of IOS devices and 802.1X. Fun stuff
without a MDM solution and not being able (and not really wanting) to manage
your devices.</p>
<p>Once we have the instructions ready to go, the site will be up. Hang in there.</p>
<p>Lastly, keep in mind that we do many things to keep your connection safe, but
keep pay close attention to the instructions and any abnormal behavior. This is
still a hacker summer camp where even your friends want to mess with you.</p>

        <p>Good Morning!  It&rsquo;s amazing what just a couple hours sleep will do for you :)</p>
<p>We hope everyone had a great DEF CON 20 Friday night.  Great turn out at all the
parties, with some great entertainment (DJ&rsquo;s, bands, etc).  Too many for any one
person to see all of them (kind of like Disneyland, right?)</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s going to be asking about DCTV - right, let&rsquo;s get on with that.
Several of us were up late (me, Mac, Richard) working on ideas to get things
fixed &amp; back to working order.  I think we finalized on Plan Echo(E).  We still
have Plan Foxtrot(F) in our back pocket.  What was wrong?  Combination of
things.  Primary issue was a codec that was mostly-standard, but slightly not.
Couple that with newer versions of software that didn&rsquo;t handle the &ldquo;slightly
not&rdquo; part right.  We found the right combination of software and command-line
flags, and at 12:30am last night declared (very quietly, so we didn&rsquo;t jinx it)
victory - at least with our proof-of-concept we setup in the NOC.  We&rsquo;ll
re-deploy equipment in a few minutes and verify our hypothesis in production!</p>
<p>Again, we apologize that things weren&rsquo;t running well yesterday.  This has been
our #1 priority to resolve since yesterday morning and appreciate your patience.
(I know I sound calm now, but I was such a stress-ball last night!!).</p>
<p>Other than that, we are having a lot of people using wifi, and great traffic.  I
think we&rsquo;re going to have to upgrade next year.  Our controller is running out
of memory throughout the day.  Rukbat has been amazingly diligent at sitting
quietly in the NOC, all day long, clearing memory, keeping it running as best he
can.  Can&rsquo;t say enough good things about Rukbat, seriously - I should do an
entire post about this guy! He&rsquo;s bloody incredible!  But meanwhile, if you do
see intermittent loss of connectivity, either wait a minute or two (I know,
patience is hard when you&rsquo;re trying to pull up a webpage with someone standing
next to you waiting on it) - or email us (noc-at-defconnetworking-dot-org) and
let us know.  A couple people did yesterday, it&rsquo;s helpful, so thank you guys.</p>
<p>Looks like all afternoon ya&rsquo;ll were using some massive bandwidth.  Here, have a
look&hellip;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re finalizing the video feeds for DCTV.  We have guys up in the CATV head-end
in the hotel working to get signal across the property properly.  Our apologizes
the delay (wouldn&rsquo;t be DEF CON without some small snafu eh?).  We&rsquo;re working as
fast as possible and will let you know when it&rsquo;s live.  (Also check @TheLockheed
on Twitter, I&rsquo;ll post updates there, too)</p>

        <p>The way SSL certs are being signed has changed.  In the past, a Root CA signed
SSL certs directly.  Now (as of this year), allegedly the industry (at least
SecureTrust/TrustWave) now have a Root CA sign an Intermediate Chain Cert, which
in turn signs all down-stream SSL certs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean to you?</p>
<p>Windows machines doing 802.1x try to validate the SSL certificate by default.
For that to happen, they have to know about the chain cert that signed the
server&rsquo;s SSL cert.</p>
<p>Windows OS&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t know about the new chain cert.  So you&rsquo;ll have to import it.</p>
<p>You can grab the cert from <a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org/ca.php">https://wifireg.defcon.org/ca.php</a></p>
<p>Download the &ldquo;wifireg.cer&rdquo; file - double-click, import it.</p>
<p>From that point, you can &ldquo;validate&rdquo; the cert and proceed.</p>
<p>(Your other option is to opt not to validate, and the login process will proceed
as if you used a self-signed cert).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been testing this the last couple hours and believe this is currently what
many people are seeing (and what we see in our logs).</p>
<p>Try this - if it doesn&rsquo;t work, let us know and we&rsquo;ll dig into it further.</p>

<p>DEF CON is sneaking up on us.</p>
<p>The NOC team heads to Vegas in a week.  Seriously, already?!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rebuilt some of the infrastructure on new equipment this year.  Kept a lot
of things the same - it&rsquo;s going to be a BIG year for DEF CON, so we want to do
all we can to make sure everything works the first time!</p>
<p>Once we get on-site, get the core infrastructure up, we&rsquo;ll let you know that
we&rsquo;re opening up wifi login registration.</p>
<p>(ok, you happy @SteveL_UK? :).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting with 100Mb to the Internet - with another 100Mb on stand-by.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got some new guys on the team this year; we&rsquo;ll see if they (or their
livers) survive!</p>
<p>Hit us us via email, or me via twitter (@TheLockheed) with questions.</p>

        <p>While the other DEF CON 20 teams, speakers, contests, etc all gear up to make
this year a massive blow-out year - we&rsquo;re actually trying to keep it simple.
That&rsquo;s our &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to making the network happen.  Don&rsquo;t over complicate things.
So as much as possible, this year&rsquo;s network will look like last year, with
tweaks &amp; improvement here &amp; there.  We&rsquo;re probably going to upgrade/swap out
some switches, but largely only because some newer stuff is available to us this
year - and we&rsquo;ll (almost never) turn down free upgrades :)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finalizing WiFi AP placement now (should have that done this week).  We&rsquo;re
talking about how much bandwidth we can get from the Rio this year.  (How much
is &ldquo;too much&rdquo;? :).</p>
<p>The DC20 network will still support IPv6.  We&rsquo;ll be curious if it gets more use
this year over last year.</p>
<p>You know how there&rsquo;s a DefCon File server on the network for you to
upload/download files from?  In honoring our past, we&rsquo;re talking about setting
up a &ldquo;Retro LAN table&rdquo; - remember the days before there was WiFi and we all came
to DEF CON and plugged into a wall jack, setup a switch, and let the people
around us share that switch (or hub!)?  We may setup something where you can
plug in, trade filez with the file server, etc.  Don&rsquo;t camp, though, share the
space please.</p>
<p>We have new folks helping with DCTV&rsquo;; they&rsquo;ve been working hard to improve
signal quality so we can get the best possible signal up to the Rio CATV system
for hand-off (even though most of the hotel rooms are still equipped with SD
CRT&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking at DEF CON 20, throwing a contest, a party, something that
requires a network connection or special request, don&rsquo;t forget to let your
specified Goon point-of-contact know.  If you&rsquo;re not sure, you can always email
me (noc -at- defconnetworking dot org) and I&rsquo;ll help you out.</p>

        <p>Oh to hell with it&hellip;Merry Christmas! :)  We hope all of you had a wonderful
Christmas, a great Hanukkah, and generally enjoyed the holidays!  2012 is the
year the Mayans predicted the world would end - and is also coincidentally the
20th anniversary of DefCon.  We&rsquo;ve been doing some early planning already to
ensure that DefCon20 is the biggest, baddest, most exciting DefCon EVER!</p>
<p>We hope everyone had a very Happy New Years - be safe in whatever activities you
chose to indulge in (or at least don&rsquo;t get caught!).</p>
<p>Effffn has suggested a new network metric - HC&rsquo;s per second (hcps).  It&rsquo;s a bit
of an inside joke (that you can never erase from your mind once you&rsquo;ve been
exposed) - but suffice it to say instead of a generic &ldquo;megabits per second&rdquo; it&rsquo;s
taking a known entity as a frame of reference.  A video for example.  Think
&ldquo;Rebecca Black&rsquo;s per second.&rdquo;  There may be something to do this&hellip;!</p>
<p>Happy New Years and see you at DefCon 20!</p>

        <p>9:30p - the day is largely over (other than parties at this point).</p>
<p>Not much bandwidth consumed today - a few spikes, but generally hovered around
10-14Mbps.</p>
<p>DCTV seems generally well-received.  The feeds from the cameras don&rsquo;t mix
speaker &amp; slides so we had to pick one feed to broadcast.  We&rsquo;re already talking
about major upgrades next year - but since this is the first time since the AP
we&rsquo;ve been able to do this, we got a lot of ideas for making DC20 a major
step-up.</p>
<p>Oh, and we got our first hate-mail today!  So sad that the world is full of hate
like that.  However, we got many more people who emailed in, or stopped us in
the halls, or tweeted us, thanking us for the network.  Apparently many more
people knew how to use wifi.  A number of people said it was much better than
over at Blackhat.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not about us &ndash; thank YOU for coming, enjoying the conference,
getting out, participating, etc!</p>
<p>We found some guys who setup a rogue DHCP server.  One of the contests,
actually.  Running a rogue DHCP server off a hard-line that we can trace through
our switches easily? Not so smart.  Extermination protocol Zeta-3 was triggered,
and successful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing anything cool with IPv6 here - let us know!  (noc at
defconetworking dot org).</p>
<p>Enjoy the parties tonight - be safe, have fun!</p>

        <p>First post! ZOMFG! l33t!</p>
<p>This post is officially made from the DefCon 19 Network!</p>
<p>The core is up and working.  A couple IDF&rsquo;s still have to be patched.  Wall
ports &amp; floor jacks are mostly patched by the hotel, just need to be patched
panel-to-switch in the IDF&rsquo;s.  The last of the AP&rsquo;s are being provisioned right
now by Luiz &amp; Erick (he&rsquo;s new this year, say hi to him!).  The NOC is up &amp;
functional!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really most exciting for us right now is that we are at least 36 hrs
ahead of schedule right now!  Some of the IT guys were around and, even though
they didn&rsquo;t expect us to be working setup today, stuck around and helped us get
stuff done!  I think we may owe them a beer or two.</p>
<p>Public wireless will come online throughout this week; the Hotel has to hang
AP&rsquo;s as space is available in all the conventions spaces - Right now there&rsquo;s the
<a href="http://www.chart.org/">CHART group</a> (Council of Hotel and Restaurant
Trainers) and <a href="http://evo2k.com/">EVO 2011</a> (a gaming con) in here.
The gamers are very DefCon-esque: They were stealing chairs from the CHART
rooms, a train of gamers carrying charts across hallways.</p>

        <p>Less than 3 weeks til the DCNET crew heads to Vegas.  We&rsquo;re planning a full test
of network gear this weekend, doing our best to make sure we&rsquo;ve got everything
as done-as-possible prior to being on-site.  Since it&rsquo;s a new year, new hotel,
we&rsquo;re trying to be prepared against the unexpected.</p>
<p>We have most everyone&rsquo;s network requirements on our list at this point.  Contest
area may be our biggest challenge - I think we have requests for more drops than
we have wall jacks in that room.  That&rsquo;s what switches are for :)</p>
<p>Looking to pre-gen user credentials for the WiFi this year and hand them out
with badges.  Would you rather have pre-gen&rsquo;d creds, or sign up for your own?
I&rsquo;ve posted the question over on the
<a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?p=121021#post121021">DC19 Network Thread</a>
on the Forums.</p>
<p>Everything is coming together, as it always does.  Not looking forward to the
Vegas heat.  However, the World Carnival Buffet might be worth it ;)</p>

        <p>Four more weeks and the Goons head off to Vegas to start DefCon setup.  New
hotel, new challenges, but we think it&rsquo;ll all pay off!</p>
<p>Our aim is to have all the core network gear fully tested, end-to-end, in a
couple weeks.  The goal is to arrive in Vegas and all we have to do is supply
power and start patching jacks!  (Let&rsquo;s hope I didn&rsquo;t just jinx it)</p>
<p>We first announced this publicly at DC4420 (London)(@DC4420) last month - but
we&rsquo;re going to bring IPv6 to the DefCon network this year.  Don&rsquo;t worry, we
didn&rsquo;t run out of IPv4 addresses.  But seriously, who better than DEFCON to
bring you an IPv6 sandbox to play in?!  Not everyone has some big lab with toys
to play with.  DefCon is YOUR lab!  Come see what you can do with v6!</p>
<p>DCTV is going to be HOT this year!  As many of you may know, we&rsquo;re teaming up
with HackerNewsNetwork (@ThisIsHNN) to provide production facilities and on-air
broadcasting.  Look for a &ldquo;Good Morning DefCon!&rdquo; (@GMDefcon) show every morning
before talks kick off, and also on-air interviews and Q&amp;A with speakers, contest
owners, and random DefCon attendees (maybe YOU!).  Better than ever, we&rsquo;re going
to make it HUGE this year!</p>

        <p>Thank you EVERYONE who made Def Con 18 so successful - which is every one of
you!  Speakers, staff, press, contest &amp; event organizers, and just as
importantly the attendees!  This was the best con I&rsquo;ve personally had in years!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still unpacking a little, but wanted to get the NOC Team&rsquo;s closing slides up
(I added a few more stats that effffn had sent over to me) so you now have the
complete set.  They are posted <a href="/media/DC18Network.pdf">here</a> [PDF, 3MB].</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be VERY interested in any feedback you have on the DefCon Mobile Edition
web-app we wrote this year.  Compliments or complaints&ndash; please, let us know if
it was even worth doing, what we could do better, etc.  We want to wrangle
together app writers (inside &amp; outside of staff) so we can make all the DefCon
apps better for you. So give us your feedback!  (noc -at- defconnetworking d0t
org)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already started planning discussions for the DC19 Network at the Rio!  See
you all there!</p>

        <p>Good MORNING!  Yes, Sunday Morning&hellip; which most people sleep through due to the
events of Saturday night.  Here at DefConNetworking, we understand.  Ugh, we
understand!</p>
<p>But last night was awesome - the Ninja&rsquo;s threw a blow-out party - it was
awesome!  Many thanks to Barkode &amp; all the Ninja Networks guys for taking care
of people.  I was really pleased to see a number of DefCon newbies at the party,
too.  They were having a blast, and I would say it was a huge success.</p>
<p>But back to the network - things have been humming away.  We&rsquo;ve heard some
people still having a hard time keeping stable wifi connections - we&rsquo;ll keep
working on that.  It&rsquo;s an issue that some devices/OS&rsquo;s have, having a hard time
deciding which AP to connect to, because they were so many around.  We
understand it&rsquo;s frustrating and we&rsquo;ll see if we can work on that for next year.
It&rsquo;s a balance between coverage and capacity (clients/AP).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&rsquo;ve peaked bandwidth at 60Mb yesterday morning (5-min average), and
even hit 54Mb this morning!  Perhaps people are grabbing all the torrents they
can while they can?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re glad to see a higher simultaneous client attach rate this year - up almost
40% over last year.  We&rsquo;ll gather more facts/stats for the closing ceremonies
and post those afterwards.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Sunday!</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s your Saturday morning update&hellip; wait, it&rsquo;s Saturday already?!</p>
<p>Wireless is working well again - we think we have a hold on the rebooting AP&rsquo;s.
We are curious if the ninja badges are interfering with wifi (or is our wifi
interferring with the badges?  The badges have the ninjas; does that make
DefCon&rsquo;s wifi the pirates?!  FIGHT!)</p>
<p>Wired network (speakers, press, staff) - 5x5.  Someone asked for a 30&rsquo;ft
cross-over cable today. Welcome to DefCon.</p>
<p>Our ISP (Sparkplug) called us last night &ndash; &ldquo;Oh hey, we went ahead &amp; opened your
line up to 100Mb - use it!&rdquo; - so please, for the sake of the children, use the
net! :)  (kick-ass of them to do that, btw!!)</p>
<p>Somehow some of us got some sleep last night - not sure how we did that, but
there it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that, roughly, 50% of the wifi users are on secure wifi.  We&rsquo;d be
curious for any feedback on how things are going out there - email us (noc at
defconnetworking dot org, or @TheLockheed on Twitter).</p>
<p>The irony is that in the DefCon NOC - we have low wifi coverage.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Saturday!  Get out, see the talks, make some friends, talk to people.
DefCon is an amazing experience, get the most out of it that you can!!  Here&rsquo;s a
quote from a DefCon Virgin this year, &ldquo;This really is the best experience I&rsquo;ve
had in my life.  And I&rsquo;m being very literal.  Thank you for your help and
support.&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://wifireg.defcon.org">https://wifireg.defcon.org</a> - Sorry, we forgot to ask DT to put this in his
public DNS servers (fail!) - so that&rsquo;s happening now.  It works from the
internal network ok.  Or from the external network you can use
<a href="https://208.95.78.182">https://208.95.78.182</a> until DNS propogates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;ve noticed some mobile devices (mostly ipads) are having issues renewing
their IP after coming out of sleep.  We&rsquo;re checking it out and seeing if we can
adjust some things on the network side that may help. We think it has to do with
having so many AP&rsquo;s that clients are talking longer than expected to settle on
which AP to associate with.</p>
</li>

<p>Otherwise, if you have any issues with the network, email us, or let dispatch

<p>Plus, Mac &amp; Videoman have the core infrastructure laid out &amp; base configs
completed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much more left to do other than show up &amp; hook it all together.  Two
weeks today until the DefCon Networking Team lands in Vegas.  Not long now, Papa
Smurf!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely going to be an interesting year with floorplan changes, wifi
changes, focus on DCTV &amp; a/v streaming (shouts to DJ Great Scott for being so
easy to work with, btw!).  And the DefCon Confessional is BACK!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re even jumping in and providing a &ldquo;Mobile Edition&rdquo; agenda webapp that will
be available locally.  We&rsquo;re testing against iPhone, Android, and Blackberries.
Look in the program for details!  (you can login and have some FourSquare-like
functionality if you want to keep up with your friends and who&rsquo;s seeing what
talks, going to what bar).</p>

        <p>We have a lot going on this year, preparing for your use &amp; pleasure.  Let me
catch you up&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning on having a &lsquo;secure&rsquo; segment of the wireless this year.  Designed
so you can get on and be (as sure as possible) that no one&rsquo;s sniffing your
traffic and you won&rsquo;t get jacked up.</p>
<p>We know 3G is getting saturated, so you need to feel OK putting your phone or
device on the net just to get to the Internet (and yes, more bandwidth for
everyone!)(How much more? waiting on pricing so we can determine).
WPA2-Enterprise with unique user/pass for everyone will secure the wireless, and
then a dedicated hard (not virtual) trunk straight to the firewall &amp; out.
Interactions between clients will be prohibited on that network.</p>
<p>DefConTV - a new &amp; revised streaming system, with multiple channels.  The DefCon
Confessional box will be back, and we&rsquo;ll stream the videos we get from there
(well, some of them :).  As well we&rsquo;ll stream the DJ&rsquo;s at the direction of DJ
Great Scott at the parties.</p>
<p>We did promise to dig up the firewall configs &amp; post them for peer-review &amp;
feedback.  It seems that /someone/ didn&rsquo;t archive them properly, so he&rsquo;s having
to go dig up the servers out of storage to pull them off the box. :)</p>
<p>Looking to be a good year!</p>

until the New Year.  But as we easy into the new year DC18 planning starts up.
We&rsquo;ll try to get that done real soon for you.</p>
<p>DT &amp; I have talked about trying some new interactivity at DC18.  Don&rsquo;t know what
that means?  Yeah, us either.  So let&rsquo;s all think up some ideas of how to get

        <p>I&rsquo;ll cross-post on the DC Forums for further discussion. [EDIT:
<a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=10745">posted here</a>]</p>
<p>I saw a story posted over on
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10302402-245.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">CNET</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always a bit disappointed when media propagate the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use the network at
the events&rdquo; item.  It&rsquo;s scare-mongering for headlines (IMHO).  DefCon is a
security event.  Expect shenanigans, but don&rsquo;t scare people away.</p>
<p>Good practices can keep you secure, just as they will on the Internet.  Turn on
your firewall, patch your system and apps, don&rsquo;t keep confidential information
on your laptop.  This is no different than what I tell my corporate users in my
day-job.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that happens on the DefCon Network that doesn&rsquo;t happen on the
Internet.</p>
<p>As the head of the DefCon Networking Team, I was approached by several
first-timers at DefCon this year who said they were &ldquo;warned&rdquo; about how hard-core
and bad/hostile/etc the network was - and after experiencing it themselves,
found it just wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Any difference-of-opinion I have regarding &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use the wifi at DefCon&rdquo; is due
to the efforts me and my team of people make in order to setup the network at
DefCon.  We put in months of planning and a lot of time and effort to make it
happen, and it&rsquo;s a big let-down when outlets like CNET make sweeping statements
like &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that end, I welcome any journalists or media to contact us to discuss the
DefCon network in more detail.</p>

discussion started on the DefCon Forums.  Look for those shortly.</p>

through to their destinations.  Life is good.</p>

        <p>The DCNET team is already on it&rsquo;s way to Vegas! Most of us arrive Sunday, with
the Canuck&rsquo;s on Monday (or is it Tuesday?).</p>
<p>Equipment has already arrived.</p>
<p>Lock will, again, attempt to not flip his vehicle this year (today marks 4 years

<p>Also, look for an update to the website this week, before the show starts.</p>

        <p>Pardon the lack of updates this year. It&rsquo;s been crazy-hectic, but we have been
working behind the scenes doing our things, in spite of the lack of
communications.</p>
<p>Derek has something pretty kick-ass lined up for letting you show your pretty
face on DefCon TV this year. &ldquo;DefCon Idol&rdquo;? No no. We know you can&rsquo;t sing, nor
would we ask you do. But be on the look out for something with a big green
button!</p>
<p>Some people are excited that we&rsquo;re going to be talking about the Network this
year. Thurs nite at 1600, we&rsquo;ll be holding the &ldquo;DefCon Networking Session&rdquo; -
we&rsquo;ll be around for a couple hours so we can chat &amp; talk with you about the
DefCon Network. We&rsquo;ll lay out some history of where we started, how we got to
where we&rsquo;re out, but MOST importantly, interact with you on your thoughts about
the network. We&rsquo;ll show you our designs and layouts - this is your chance to
participate and provide feedback. I should note not to expect changes from this
session to show up <em>this</em> year - we&rsquo;ll already be done by the time this talk
happens, but we&rsquo;re interested in how you think things can be approved (balancing
security, functionality, and budget&ndash;oh, wait, don&rsquo;t have one of those,
nevermind).</p>
<p>As a pre-cursor, Lock will be giving 5 mins on the DefCon Network at the
DefCon101 talk earlier Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Table of Doom! I&rsquo;ve been so busy I haven&rsquo;t opened registration! My bad,
sorry guys. If you want in on this massive data dump of the DefCon network, drop
me email [lock-at-defconetworking.org] and ask for a spot. I have 8 spots, 2
already spoken for. Plan on bringing 1-2TB of disk for capture.</p>
<p>Finally - we&rsquo;re working on a visual re-vamp for the site here. I&rsquo;ll own up, I
threw this together in stock-HTML one afternoon a few years ago. I was hoping to
have it done by now, but matters of state have kept me away from doing updates.
But check back soon!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten our copy submitted for the program. We have our rooms lined-up.
We&rsquo;re starting to pack up the pelican cases for shipping. We&rsquo;re making the final
network layout plans now. Yup, I love the smell of DefCon in the air (slightly
sweeter than naplam, but just a deadly!)</p>
<p>See ya&rsquo;ll in a couple weeks!</p>

        <p>For years, the inner-workings of the DefCon NOC were kept under wraps. Last year
Wired was allowed a sneak-peak inside.</p>
<p>This year at DefCon17 we are opening the kimono. In true open-source style, we
are holding a peer-review discussion session. We will be showing you how the
DefCon NOC operates, how the network is laid out, designed, what it is we do.</p>
<p>This is not a typical lecture-style talk, but instead intended to be an
interactive session, which is why we&rsquo;ve arranged to hold it in the more intimate
setting. We often get people interested in participating as part of the team -
this is our way of opening up and allowing you to have a chance to review the
network, make suggestions, tell us where you think we could improve upon things,
and make your own contribution to DefCon!</p>

        <p>Damn, I&rsquo;ve been slow in updates. The planning has been busy, however. Final
network plans are done. Bandwidth is procurred. WiFi for EVERYONE! :)</p>
<p>The hotel did some big upgrades on their network infrastructure this year; we&rsquo;ve
reviewed it with them (and approve!). We&rsquo;ve gotten some new gear which should
boost stability in our core network, as well. We&rsquo;re trying to do very little new
this year so we can focus on increased stablity and coverage.</p>
<p>I have been slow in doing anything for the Table of Doom capture stations. I
have seen your emails and I need to get back to ya&rsquo;ll on that (including you,
Larry! :).</p>
<p>For our team, the journey to Vegas starts in a week, when we begin setup. Holy
crap, is it that soon? Stock up on beer, boys &amp; girls&hellip;it&rsquo;s gonna be fun!</p>

        <p>Planning has begun! We had our first face-to-face meeting a couple weeks ago in
a Very Cold Place. Many of us will be attending Layer One in Pasadena, CA, in
May&ndash; so we&rsquo;ll have another face-to-face there and should be thru 40-50% of our
planning at that point.</p>
<p>DCTV will be in full effect. Derek has some ideas&ndash;which could be quite killer.</p>
<p>Last year we did the Table of Doom (the official network-capture opportunity). I
think I&rsquo;d like to re-name it. So send me suggestions as to what to call it.
We&rsquo;ll again allow 8-10 slots for people to come setup their capture kit.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how much bandwidth we had last year - AND YOU USED IT! It&rsquo;s like
none of you have seen real broadband before&ndash;oh wait, most of us are from the US
where the idea of broadband sucks :) Well we had lots of it last year and should
have, again, plenty this year.</p>

<p>This year we&rsquo;re doing a YouTube-like system so YOU can provide content to DCTV.
The DCTV will be broadcast over the convention CATV system. The skyboxes, the
hallways, all the con space where there&rsquo;s a TV, there&rsquo;s DCTV. We&rsquo;re working to
try to get a TV or two setup in the hang-out area, too. We&rsquo;ll have information

<p>DefCon presents a really unique opportunity. You know how hostile the
environment is. Have you ever wondered what that traffic looks like? All you
need do is ask. For years we&rsquo;ve provided people the ability to plug in a
capture/sniffer box and capture public con traffic to take back to your Evil
Laboratory(tm) for analysis after con (you know, once you&rsquo;ve sobered up &amp;
stuff). If you want in on the action, email us so we can RSVP a spot for you on
our Table-of-Doom in the NOC.</p>

        <p>Why yes, we are in the midst of planning for DC15. Now that we&rsquo;ve &ldquo;done the
dance&rdquo; with the hotel (who are awesome folks, btw!) we know what we can and
can&rsquo;t do and should have virtually no surprizes this year. We&rsquo;re planning higher
bandwidth, better monitoring, and also some new interactive-type stuff (I
hesitate speaking of it for fear of jinxing it!). We&rsquo;re actually spending our
funds boosting up our own infrastructure (beyond the Arbua kit we have) so we
have more ports, better fibre connectivity, better trunking.</p>
<p>Remember, if you&rsquo;re planning anything &ldquo;special&rdquo;, have specific needs for your
talk, for your demo, for your break-out session, let us know EARLY so we can
plan for it.</p>
